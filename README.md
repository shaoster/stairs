## Command Shortcuts (from setup.sh)

`migrate`: runs the admin migration command.

# Info

This project is a minimal scaffold generated based on the tutorial at https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.2/intro/tutorial01/

The goal of this current iteration is to learn the tools as opposed to create a production-ready setup.
